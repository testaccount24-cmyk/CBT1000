MASSCHG performs an ISPF Edit Macro against all members or a selection
of members of one to four partitioned data sets.

Editing can be performed in either the foreground or in batch

See HELP Tutorial panels for more information.

   Members:

      $README  - this member
      $RECV    - Exec to RECEIVE the component libraries
      EXEC     - TSO Transmit of the Rexx Execs
      MSGS     - TSO Transmit of the ISPF Messages
      PANELS   - TSO Transmit of the ISPF Panels
      SKELS    - TSO Transmit of the ISPF Skeletons

Installation:
  From any ISPF command line enter:
    TSO EX 'this.data.set.name($RECV)'
